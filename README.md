## Overview

### The challenge

- The main challenge I faced during this project was implementing hover effects, something I hadn't done before. Although I understood the theory, I struggled with applying it in practice. After some research, I was finally able to implement a simple hover effect with button:hover {}.

## My process

When I first looked at the design, I thought it would be straightforward. But after downloading the starter files and exploring them, I felt a bit lost since it was my first project from Frontend Mentor. I explored the design folder, then began coding in HTML.

I worked through various tags to build the structure and started adding styles. I used a live server to see the changes in real time, and it didn't look like I expected at first. By applying Flexbox and Grid, I managed to get it closer to the desired look. I continued adding styles until it matched the design specifications.

However, there was still a gapâ€”I hadn't applied hover effects to the buttons. It took some time to figure out, but I eventually got it working by referencing the MDN documentation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a lot about using Grid and Flexbox to structure layouts and had a great experience. I now feel more confident with these techniques.

I also learned about hover effects, which was something completely new to me.
